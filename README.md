# asscii
This code takes an image file as input and generates ASCII art from it. Here's how it works:

It loads the image file using the PIL library.
It resizes the image to the specified width while maintaining the aspect ratio.
It converts the image to grayscale.
It converts each pixel of the grayscale image to an ASCII character based on its intensity.
It prints the ASCII art to the console.
To use this script:

Save the code to a Python file (e.g., ascii_art_generator.py).
Install the PIL library if you haven't already (pip install Pillow).
Run the script and provide the path to the image file you want to convert to ASCII art.
Optionally, you can specify the desired width of the ASCII art (default is 100).
